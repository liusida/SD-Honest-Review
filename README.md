# SD-Honest-Review
Offers transparent and non-cherry-picking evaluations of Stable Diffusion derivatives

## Coming Soon...
SD-Honest-Review is a GitHub repository dedicated to providing transparent and non-cherry-picking evaluations of Stable Diffusion models and their derivatives (other checkpoints and LoRAs).

Utilizing a consistent framework, this repository features comprehensive reviews that highlight the default behaviors of each model using standardized seeds and prompts. It includes a curated list of models with detailed metadata and download links in the models.json file, Python scripts for generating and saving evaluations, and a structured output folder for both default and community-contributed results. This open platform encourages community involvement, allowing users to contribute their evaluations and gain honest insights into the capabilities and distinctions of various image generation models.
